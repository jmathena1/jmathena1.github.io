				<li>(2023-08-06) Some guardian angels took the liberty of assembling a free CS curriculum. There's links to textbooks

                <li>I came across this site when I was trying to prep for a technical interview that had a design patterns portion.
                    I didn't end up needing the patterns discussed here but they're really well laid out and writtten. There's both
                    psuedo code and implementations of each design patterns in multiple languages. the use cases are also well chosen
                    and practical.
