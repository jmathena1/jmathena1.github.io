    <p>Hi, I'm John and I like to write. Thanks for coming to my site.</p>
    <p>Click on one of the logos at the bottom to check out some of my writings.</p>
    <p>My poetry and stories often come from memorable experiences or vivid dreams 
    I remember to jot down and return to when I have time to process them. I've
    written about everything from an abandoned zoo in Morocco, a peace walk I attended in my city,
    and a dream where the devil trained me to be a demon.</p>
    <p>Professionally, I work as a software developer. My deepest expertise is in data engineering
    and I pivoted to software after working as a data analyst for a couple years. I also do some web
    development if I'm building a tool for non-developers. I use my portfolio page to flesh out 
    any interesting ideas and showcase existing work.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or wanna reach out to chat about something, please do so! You can 
    send me an email at <a href="mailto:jmathena24@gmail.com">jmathena24@gmail.com</a> 
    or reach out through some of the social media links at the top.
