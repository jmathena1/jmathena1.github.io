				<li>Shiny is R's framework for building apps. Great stepping stone to UI and web dev
					if you don't have that background. You can build Shiny apps entirely in R but also bring 
					in modules that use HTML/CSS/JS as you want to and are able.</li>

				<li>Shiny like framework that is specifically for dashboards. We know how much analysts love
					building dashboards!</li>
				<li>flexdashboard is great for small, regular reports. i used it for a couple monthly reports I
					needed that used to just be excel files. once i got the user satisfied with the visuals, i just changed
					the underlying data every month. pretty sure I used the `RMariaDB` library to connect to our AWS
					MySQL instance and just run the same query based on the month.</li>
