				<li>Docker and containers are another concept I've heard for years since getting into coding and never
					quite wrapped my head around...until I stopped being lazy and searched for articles on freeCodeCamp!
					If you've looked at all the posts, I imagine this site just looks like free advertising for freeCodeCamp.
					And well if you feel some kinda way about that, tell Quincy Larson and company to stop putting out
					such high quality content for free.99!
				</li>
				<li>back to the point. from reading the two container articles above, I've learned that containers allow
					a developer to store everything needed to run their software in a neat, small little package. Docker calls
					them images I believe, and an instance of an image is called something else but that's in the article. 
					With containers, you don't have to worry about running a million VMs on your hardware to handle all the software
					you wanna touch. VMs (virtual machines) still have their use, though. TLDR: have no fear the container
					articles are here!
