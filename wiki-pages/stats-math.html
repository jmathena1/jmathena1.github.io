			<ul>
				<li>you can never go wrong with accesible math resources! everybody loves being reminded
					of their favorite subject in school. apologies for the sarcasm to those of you who did always
					love math. I'll say that I'm one of those people now. I grew into it!</li>

			<ul>
				<li>so here's a free textbook written by a mathematician who got their PhD from the London School of
					Economics</li>
				<li>stats in general and probability specifically are highly applicable but not highly accesible.</li>

				<li>(2023-05-30) most of the language AIs we've been hearing about lately are very very good at math.
					it allows these models to do some very cool stuff (and some very not cool stuff) but this book tries
					to get you up to speed on what's happening under the hood. one day i'll actually go through these damn
					books. one day when i have infinite time</li>

				<li>medium post listing free (or cheap) resources to different maths essential to data science:
					linear algebra, calculus, statistics, etc.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>an intro book for pure math AKA writing proofs, forming mathematical arguments, forming
					mathematical problems to investigate.</li>
				<li>very cool, very intimidating. but the intro seemed well written and engaging which is very much
					not a given in this field.</li>
