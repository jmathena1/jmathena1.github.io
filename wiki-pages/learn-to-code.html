				<li>lots of links in this wiki could honestly go here but I want to try and limit this

                <li>as someone who has learned lots of different data visualizations frameworks, I definitely support the
                thinking behind this. Vega is described on the homepage as "a visualization grammar, a declarative
                language". now i just need a project to try with this. I'm sure I'll think of something</li>

                <li>one of the hosts of this video game podcast i started listening to mentioned this article. It's long, but well
                    worth the read. i've long planned to try making some games and as this post points out, it's not only ok to start
                    with something small, but encouraged! it's also ok for your game to remain small in scope. one day i'll make a
                    game. one day!

                <li>pretty much the moment I saw this little database of programming books I added a bunch of them to my storygraph
                    for safe keeping. i'm putting it here to so I can see if any new books get added over time. As of this writing,
                    the count is at 70!
