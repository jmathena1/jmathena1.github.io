				<li>decentralization is definitely a term people throw around a lot because it makes them sound
					smart and progressive. i don't think decentralization is itself a bad thing but it's also good
					to be precise about what we want and how we want to do it. this article breaks down different
					decentralization frameworks in networking including mesh networks, blockchains, and more.</li>

				<li>(2023-05-30) as i progress forward in my development career, I will eventually be architecting not
					just apps but entire systems. I saw a couple people post about this book and I intend on beefing up
					my systems knowledge to be successful as an SME eventually. </li>

				<li>this medium article argues good software is exstensible and doesn't try to do to much. it points to programs like Obsidian, the notetaking app, 
					and unix-based command line paradigms. it's a rare article where most of the products they discussed I have both used and enjoyed!

				<li>this is the transcript of a talk the author gave to Startup School. it stressed the
					importance of working through the little problems and not needing to always
					swing for the fences when making a company or just working on problems in general.
					there were lots of littles gems throughout the talk as well like how "logic" and
					"reason" are useful but can also trap us in dogmatic thinking. not one for business
					world, ted talk stuff (this wasn't a ted talk but just that kind of presentation), but
					this one was solid.
