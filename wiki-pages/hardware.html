				<li>recompilier is a super cool technology magazine published by <a href="(http://lifeofaudrey.com/">Audrey Eschright</a>, 
					whom I believed I heard of from a podcast (Team Human maybe? don't quote me on that). a self described feminist hacker
					magazine, most of the authors are women and it's some of the most passionate and accesible tech writing
					I've found thus far. it features both commentary on the cultural and political aspects of the tech field
					and in depth tutorials (sometimes in the same article!)</li>
				<li>the actual article I've linked makes a plea for using basic hardware for play, art, and exploration
					rather than just mindless tracking and whatever work is handed down from above. several of the hardware
					art projects detailed are linked as well as more reading on experimenting with hardware, libraries
					the author built, 60s cyberculture, history of computing, and more! it's a fun quick read</li>
