				<li>coming from Linguistics, I'm equal parts fascinated by computers' capabilities using language and
					frustrated by the things people insist computers do when they really don't. Dr. Emily Bender here

                        Windows doesn't make me too mad unless I need to code. for some reason Vim was getting all wonky on Windows
                        compared to my work machine which is a Mac. well this certainly got off topic huh?
