                <li>(2024-05-03) quick and dirty way to play around with any csv data you find. I did try to use a CSV file from my
                    desktop and it wouldn't come up. but that may be just because I was using Windows. dang Windows

                <li>I started using Inoreader to follow the RSS feeds of all my favorite writers and bloggers that publish such
                    a feed. I do have a number of content creators on tiktok and youtube who I would love to add to a similar type
                    of feed for video content. I'll have to make some time for this. I've enjoyed curating a little collection of
                    my favorite writers, artists, etc., and not just relying on The Algorithm to feed me endlessly.

                <li>i didn't fully understand everything that was happening in this article, but I've thought about how I would recreate a home video library in the digital age.
                    The trick is creating one that doesn't rely on a Google or another platform that could just pull the rug out from under you and decide that movie isn't yours
                    anymore. This would be fun to try an implement on a small scale.</li>
