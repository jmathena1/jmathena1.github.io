				<li>the "tutor" websites let you type code for python and pandas (a python library for data analysis)
					directly into your browser. the site will then show you how the code executes your code and transforms
					your data. great tool if you are new to pandas/python and/or prefer visual examples when learning.</li>

				<li>web scraping always sounded so cool but so beyond my capabilities as a programmer. these articles
					helped me get my first scraper off the ground. very accesible for newer users of python. </li>
				<li>my first scraper was actually needed for work. i had to scrape a database of phone numbers from a
					website to populate a database for our IVR phone system to use. lots of work but I can't remember
					if we ended up actually using it.

				<li>this book was a follow up to a test driven development Python book that I also intend to read. as I move up in seniority,
					I want to start thinking about software at a higher level; different codebases working together, 
					making sure they can handle increasing complexity, etc.</li>

				<li>i didn't fully understand this piece the first time through. but i wanna come back to it as I grow as a developer.
					I did take away how much new development builds off work done often for free and/or many years or decades prior
					and I've always found that so fascinating.</li>
