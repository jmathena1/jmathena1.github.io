				<li>early in the COVID-19 pandemic, an older programming language called COBOL came under fire for
					supposedly busting up several states' worth of unemployment queues. many COBOL programmers had retired
					and weren't there to kill bugs when the masses rightfully took advantage of expanded unemeployment.</li>
				<li>as the article above lays out, COBOL hadn't really been the problem at all in many cases. In at least
					one case, the consumer facing website was causing the error. JavaScript being the cuplrit, no less.</li>
				<li>much of the actual COBOL issues were due to poor maintenance and rooted in the lack of respect for COBOL.
					many programmers see its simple syntax and commands unworthy of their big serious programmer brains
					and don't take the time to learn it though it powers finance departments and banks across the world.</li>
