				<li>utils is short for utilities and i believe programmers create utils files to store code
					that they will use throughout a piece of software. 
					helps us stay DRY (don't repeat yourself)</li>
				<li>but i'm also using it here to just mean things i find useful. might fit the definition above too.
					and it might not</li>

			<ul>
				<li>regular expressions (regex) are code that represent a pattern. you can search a text 
					(string or group of strings in programming parlance) for a pattern you construct to help you extract
					text you need from a large document or series of documents.</li>
				<li>the regex tester is helpful because you can paste any text in it, create a pattern to test, and the
					tester will tell you exactly what your pattern picks up. a huge time saver</li>
