- (2023-08-06) Some guardian angels took the liberty of assembling a free CS curriculum. There's links to textbooks
video lectures, exercises, and more! As I embark on becoming an SME, I intend on using these resources to replace 
my lack of a CS degree!

- I came across this site when I was trying to prep for a technical interview that had a design patterns portion.
I didn't end up needing the patterns discussed here but they're really well laid out and writtten. There's both
psuedo code and implementations of each design patterns in multiple languages. the use cases are also well chosen
and practical.

- story time! i blanked on a technical interview question a couple job applications ago. It involved reversing a 
Binary Tree (B Tree). It's a pretty standard question for devs with a CS background. But if you haven't worked 
with tree data structures much, well...you're lost. After that interview, I read all I could about trees and got 
busy doing practice problems. I won't be caught flatfooted again, but I don't think I got a very deep 
understanding. This article was outstanding. One of the best technical blog posts I've read in general, let alone 
for B Trees. with interactive demonstrations! and a whole dedicated site for them?? terrific

- designer of Zod illustrates the value of type driven design. i feel like this is especially usefuly  in data intensive applications
