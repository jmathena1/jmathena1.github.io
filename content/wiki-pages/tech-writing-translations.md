- (2023-05-31) i started a mentoring program at work got paired with an engineering manager. i asked them if they 
knew how developers could utilize any foreign language skills they had. he pointed me to this site. it's basically 
a repository for every large open source project there is and it indexes what parts of the project need to be 
translated and into what languages.
- (2023-05-31) i saw that [QGIS Documentation](https://explore.transifex.com/qgis/qgis-documentation/) is only 
like 20 percent done with Arabic so that's definitely something i could help with.

- seems to be a listserv/meetup/forum type of thing for technical writers or people who are into that. people 
like me essentially. they have a slack group and their website lists a bunch of resources for aspiring and 
current writers including job help, in person meets, and guides i think.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/](https://www.reddit.com/<br>r/technicalwriting/)
- sweet subreddit that i joined in 2022. very well moderated and organized. they have a whole pinned thread with 
an FAQ and guide to get into technical writing.
- in general, the programming subreddits i read are super interesting and people are very generous with their 
time and knowledge. the times i've seen someone act like an a$$hole there's several people to push back and 
pump up the victim. not something you see on the internet everyday

- i think i came across this site from [r/technicalwriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/) but it's 
apparently run by volunteer federal employees and has been since the 90s. crazy! PLAIN essentially promotes the 
use of plain language in US federal government communcation. a very noble pursuit!

- freeCodeCamp made a whole book on localization! for free! they also have a section at end detailing how you can 
contribute to freeCodeCamp itself with translations. very savvy
