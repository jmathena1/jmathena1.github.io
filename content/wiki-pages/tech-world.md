- (2023-05-24) outlets like logic magazine do such a good job of showcasing technology development and use beyond 
just silicon valley. [rest of world](https://restofworld.org/) also does great writing and reporting in this area 
so this page will probably showcase some of their stuff eventually. all these articles also put the person at the 
center. the tech is cool, yes. the tech can help us, yes. but the people make it happen. and the people make it 
better! 
- dr. loubani had a great quote in the last article about how the tourniquets his group manufactured in Canada 
were breaking in the field in Gaza. the palestinian medics were like "these things are snapping" and he didn't 
get why until he was in the field trying to use one while getting shot at and dodging shrapnel. an extreme example 
but ultimately people make the tech work, not the other way around!
