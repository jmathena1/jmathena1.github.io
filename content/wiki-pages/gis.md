- programming historian hosts all sorts of coding tutorials. the whole site is geared toward
humanities scholars who want to build tools, visualizations, or other digital products to showcase or enhance 
their work. I don't think you need any prior GIS knowledge to get going on this.

- leaflet is a dope mapping library. R has a wrapper for it which I where I used it most. I found it very 
intuitive and well supported.

- free GIS software for the hardcore mapping nerds. Maps are the best. Pretty good documentation
and lots of walkthroughs exist out there. I needed to do an intersect for work and didn't have an
ArcGIS license. I downloaded QGIS for the first time ever and got what I needed within a day.

- somebody made an open source mapping apps a la google maps. I don't think a navigation component is available yet 
but I believe it is in the works. I'll update when available.
