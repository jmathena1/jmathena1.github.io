- I didn't follow this tutorial exactly when building my blogs on this site.
- But I completed some of the steps and ended up hosting on GitHub Pages (so easy!).
- The post above lists numerous references for Git, GitHub, Markdown, and Jekyll, all of which
- I ended up using in different capacities to launch the site you're browsing!

- MK Docs is another static site generator, but it's gotta be the most lightweight one I've seen yet.
- Their site says it's geared toward project documentation, which makes sense from seeing examples.
- I learned recently that the [Baltimore Black Techies website](http://bmoreblack.tech) 
is built using MK docs. It's nice to know I can quickly spin up some great project documentation for 
future work! I'll be sure to link any sites I push out using this framework here.
