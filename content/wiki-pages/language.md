- I majored in Linguistics in college, so I gotta keep a special place here on my site for cool language nerd stuff.

- coming from Linguistics, I'm equal parts fascinated by computers' capabilities using language and frustrated 
by the things people insist computers do when they really don't. Dr. Emily Bender here writes a very compelling 
thought experiment demonstrating that LLMs (large language models) like ChatGPT don't really "understand" 
human language. They merely manipulate its form. Ted Chiang makes a similar point about how computers really 
process information in this [New Yorker article<](

- now I still want learn Perl (eventually), but this sounds really nice and the demo was sick. also now that I've 
got WSL up and running, I can install linux things!! one day I'll have a pure linux set up. I could just dual boot or wipe my windows and reinstall whatever distro I'm feeling. But that takes a lot of work. Windows doesn't make 
me too mad unless I need to code. for some reason Vim was getting all wonky on Windows compared to my work machine 
which is a Mac. well this certainly got off topic huh?

- a friend told me a story about seeing a documentary claiming mermaids were real on the Discovery channel. they
said it was presented not as a mocumentary or anything, making it a very odd watch. that documentary definitely
fits the category described in this piece.
- i also read one of the books listed in this piece, which was a collection of short stories.

- online database that allows you to search by title for translated works. i think you can find results in the source language or the target language
- I've tried to search for some Arabic literature and the results were decent
