- This is Cathy O'Neil's blog. She is the author of 
[_Weapons of Math Destruction_](
https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/241363/weapons-of-math-destruction-by-cathy-oneil/)
- WMD (lol, great title) came out in 2016 and was very ahead of its time in critiquing the unregulated use of 
big data and algorithms in a variety of domains. She has a more recent book out called the Shame Machine. 
- (2023-05-22) She appears to post pretty intermittently, which I've found makes blogs more punchy.
She's an incredibly concise writer and has written two best selling books in less than a decade on top of running
an algorithmic consulting business. I wouldn't expect her to be doing free work on top of that any more often
    then she deems necessary.

- Vicki is a machine learning engineer and offers very sober, realistic, and approachable AI commentary.
She doesn'tpost to her blog super often, but when she does it's very worth reading. She's a good person to read to 
dig through the AI hype and	try to understand what building products using this stuff actually looks like 
day to day.

- i want to build this so bad! i need to figure out some authentication though. and that would be great practice! 
prolly not a good idea to just have all the precious info on your house floating about in the ether.

- definitely a favorite of mine. in addition to programming and building software, Julia makes programming related
zines. they're all for sale on her website. her git ones in particular I've really enjoyed.
