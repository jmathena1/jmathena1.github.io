- you can never go wrong with accesible math resources! everybody loves being reminded of their favorite subject in 
school. apologies for the sarcasm to those of you who did always love math. I'll say that I'm one of those people 
now. I grew into it!

- so here's a free textbook written by a mathematician who got their PhD from the London School of Economics. stats 
in general and probability specifically are highly applicable but not highly accesible

- (2023-05-30) most of the language AIs we've been hearing about lately are very very good at math. it allows 
these models to do some very cool stuff (and some very not cool stuff) but this book tries to get you up to speed 
on what's happening under the hood. one day i'll actually go through these damn books. one day when i have 
infinite time

- medium post listing free (or cheap) resources to different maths essential to data science: linear algebra, 
calculus, statistics, etc.

- an intro book for pure math AKA writing proofs, forming mathematical arguments, forming mathematical problems to 
investigate.
- very cool, very intimidating. but the intro seemed well written and engaging which is very much not a given in 
this field.
