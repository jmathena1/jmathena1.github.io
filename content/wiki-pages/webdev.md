- web development is what i believe most people imagine when they think of coding. building websites and web apps. 
i mean it's how a lot of programmers get into the field. when so many people use websites to do so much, if your 
web presence is trash, your business will feel it.

- i have been doing freeCodeCamp's various web development coding tracks but this curriculum seemed like a real 
one stop shop. if you could get through all the lessons and assignments on this site, you'll be a pretty 
accomplished web developer.
