- utils is short for utilities and i believe programmers create utils files to store code that they will use 
throughout a piece of software. helps us stay DRY (don't repeat yourself)
- but i'm also using it here to just mean things i find useful. might fit the definition above too. and it might 
not

- regular expressions (regex) are code that represent a pattern. you can search a text (string or group of strings 
in programming parlance) for a pattern you construct to help you extract text you need from a large document or 
series of documents.
- the regex tester is helpful because you can paste any text in it, create a pattern to test, and the tester will 
tell you exactly what your pattern picks up. a huge time saver

- the lovely folks over at [Fallthrough pod](https://fallthrough.transistor.fm/) mentioned this site as one of their favorite tools to use. It's basically a much more performant
search for code examples across publicly available code repositories.
