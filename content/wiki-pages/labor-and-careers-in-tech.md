- there's lots of gatekeeping in software. hierarchies of tech roles within an organization or field. in a male 
dominated field, there's unfortunately a lot of jockeying for status. and that of course takes its toll on the 
women who are entering or currently working in tech
- as they point out in the article, the early days of computing were dominated by women. the field itself was 
founded and then tremendously advanced by women as well - Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper - though that didn't
stop the men from taking over once industry thought they could make money with these machines.

- social impacts of technology or otherwise, dr. tressie mcmillan cottom is one of our best contemporary social 
scientsts - she's a sociologist by training. her book of essays [Thick](https://thenewpress.com/books/thick/)

is high on my reading list!

- great breakdown of [the sexiest job of the 21st century](
https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) lots of hype surrounding data science 
in general and AI in particular
- (2023-05-28) interviewee gives a pretty entertaining overview of the field as of 2017. even post chat-gpt,
not much has changed.

- a reader of this blog i guess wrote in to the author asking if they should get a new job. they don't like being 
a senior and want more IC work. author said do it! GTFO! their rationale was that a new position would be a chance 
to gain seniority all over again and grow a ton (reader mentioned this was their first job). 
it's important to hear that it's ok to remain at the mid-level so you can learn and grow. US work culture 
prioritizes growth above all else so this advice is golden especially from a seasoned developer.

- i love learning about learning. and this is a great article for that. it's aimed at software developers 
but i think it applies to anyone really.

https://praachi.work/blog/questions-to-ask-in-a-job-interview)
- i actually used this for my most recent job search process. I liked this post because while it did have some
specific questions, it mostly gave you a framework or way to think about how to ask questions to your interviewer.
great read if you're prepping for an interview in tech or out of it.
