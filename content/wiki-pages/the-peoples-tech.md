- very succinct breakdown of the limits of computers. goes into human-in-the-loop systems and how to know when something just 
needs to be done by a person. hint: it's a lot more often than many want to admit.
- The author, Dr. Meredith Broussard, wrote a deeper dive into dumb computers in [Artificial Unintelligence](
https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262537018/artificial-unintelligence/). That book's been on my list for a hot minute, so if you check 
it out and like it let me know.

- Project Cybersyn is criminally underdiscussed in the tech and lefty circles in which I've found myself. the chilean people 
democratically elected a socialist in 1970 (albeit narrowly) and the president directly appointed a team to modernize the 
economy using IT.
- though a classic US backed coup preceded by brutal economic blockades and sanctions ended Allende's presidency in a series 
of firing squads, the project remains inspirational. at least to me
- if you want a deeper dive, Professor Eden Medina wrote a wonderful book on the project called [Cybernetic Revolutionaries](

- the first director of post-revolutionary Cuba's national library in Havana wanted the _biblioteca popular_ to take an active 
approach to educating and enriching the lives of  Cuban residents. they drove buses out to the farms and indexed books banned by 
previous regimes. they also made leaps and bounds in library IT, making huge contributions to the field that would become
information science.
- it's so thrilling and motivating to see people around the world fight so hard to build better worlds for themselves and their 
people in the face of such hardship, especially through computing. the field doesn't have a huge reputation for freeing the 
masses though many coders may wanna believe that.

- a moderately peeved Ursula K. Le Guin critiques many SciFi enthusiasts' superficial and one-dimensional understanding of 
technology. one reviewer desribed her as "not a hard SF writer", "technology is notably absent".
- perhaps the story this person reviewed didn't feature faster than light travel or hoverbikes, but after reading the 
Dispossessed I'd be pretty off base calling Le Guin a soft SciFi writer.
- as she lays out in just a few paragraphs, technology is everything people do to interact with their physical environment. It's 
not just what's happening in an R&D lab.
- on top of that, just as if not more interesting than how the machines in any fictional universe work is how their societies 
work. she covers that too

- There's definitely a lot of charged writing you can find out there on AI, in either direction. What I like about Ted Chiang's 
AI writing is that I think it's on point (He's underwelmed by it, as am I), but he's incredibly measured and deliberate in his 
explanation of Gen AI's shortcomings. I personally have no problems with the more vitriolic takedowns (the hype cycle we've been 
through since ChatGPT has been very trying), but there are some valuable nuggests in the AI craze. Machine learning in general I 
think is a very valuable field for Medicine and Health as well as very data intensive fields like Astronomy. Helpful to have 
writers like Chiang be specific about where it falls short. He has at least one other New Yorker essay on Gen AI that is 
also very worth reading.
