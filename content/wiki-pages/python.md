- the "tutor" websites let you type code for python and pandas (a python library for data analysis) directly into 
your browser. the site will then show you how the code executes your code and transforms your data. great tool if 
you are new to pandas/python and/or prefer visual examples when learning.

- web scraping always sounded so cool but so beyond my capabilities as a programmer. these articles helped me get 
my first scraper off the ground. very accesible for newer users of python.
- my first scraper was actually needed for work. i had to scrape a database of phone numbers from a website to 
populate a database for our IVR phone system to use. lots of work but I can't remember if we ended up actually 
using it.

- this book was a follow up to a test driven development Python book that I also intend to read. as I move up in 
seniority, I want to start thinking about software at a higher level; different codebases working together, making 
sure they can handle increasing complexity, etc.

- i didn't fully understand this piece the first time through. but i wanna come back to it as I grow as a developer.
I did take away how much new development builds off work done often for free and/or many years or decades prior	and
I've always found that so fascinating.
