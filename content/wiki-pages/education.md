- nice brief of the history of education expansion in the US; mainly summarizing the public high school movement 
and development of the University of California and California State University systems in the mid 20th century
- as per usual (in my view): a person, place or thing in the US came up with a nifty solution to a sticky problem 
but never broke out nationwide because black people might use it
- white liberals in the 60s ran out of steam (allegedly) trying to enforce desegregation and couldn't (or wouldn't)
expand the generous UC and CSU higher ed funding scheme to the federal level. Instead we got student loans. 
lucky us!
