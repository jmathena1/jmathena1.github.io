- lots of links in this wiki could honestly go here but I want to try and limit this to resources aimed at 
people with little to no coding experience in general or in a specific area and looking to break into this 
crazy world

- (2023-05-28) I have yet to try any of these but these projects are on my neverending list	of self-study resources
to go through.
- all or most of the books are free to read electronically. we love our free learning materials here!

- as someone who has learned lots of different data visualizations frameworks, I definitely support the 
thinking behind this. Vega is described on the homepage as "a visualization grammar, a declarative language". 
now i just need a project to try with this. I'm sure I'll think of something

- one of the hosts of this video game podcast i started listening to mentioned this article. It's long, but well
worth the read. i've long planned to try making some games and as this post points out, it's not only ok to start
with something small, but encouraged! it's also ok for your game to remain small in scope. one day i'll make a 
game. one day!

- pretty much the moment I saw this little database of programming books I added a bunch of them to my storygraph
for safe keeping. i'm putting it here to so I can see if any new books get added over time. As of this writing, the
count is at 70!
