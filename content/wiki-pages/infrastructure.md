- Docker and containers are another concept I've heard for years since getting into coding and never quite wrapped 
my head around...until I stopped being lazy and searched for articles on freeCodeCamp! If you've looked at all 
the posts, I imagine this site just looks like free advertising for freeCodeCamp. And well if you feel some kinda 
way about that, tell Quincy Larson and company to stop putting out such high quality content for free.99!
- back to the point. from reading the two container articles above, I've learned that containers allow a developer
to store everything needed to run their software in a neat, small little package. Docker calls them images I 
believe, and an instance of an image is called something else but that's in the article. With containers, you don't
have to worry about running a million VMs on your hardware to handle all the software you wanna touch. VMs (virtual 
machines) still have their use, though. TLDR: have no fear the container articles are here!

- cloud is not bad, but needn't always be the solution. good post asking developers to right size their insfrastructure choices. no need
to run to AWS for everything!
