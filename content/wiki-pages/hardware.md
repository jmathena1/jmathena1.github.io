- recompilier is a super cool technology magazine published by [Audrey Eschright](http://lifeofaudrey.com/) whom I 
believed I heard of from a podcast (Team Human maybe? don't quote me on that). a self described feminist hacker
magazine, most of the authors are women and it's some of the most passionate and accesible tech writing I've found 
thus far. it features both commentary on the cultural and political aspects of the tech field and in depth tutorials
(sometimes in the same article!)
- the actual article I've linked makes a plea for using basic hardware for play, art, and exploration 
rather than just mindless tracking and whatever work is handed down from above. several of the hardware art projects
detailed are linked as well as more reading on experimenting with hardware, libraries the author built, 60s 
cyberculture, history of computing, and more! it's a fun quick read
