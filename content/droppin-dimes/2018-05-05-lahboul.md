Welcome to Lahboul  
Take in the sights  
Of fools, ghouls, and tools   
Without any rights

You can shield your eyes and ears  
As you try desperately to blend  
But your mere existence incites fear  
Your futile urban camouflage amounts to a dead end

Creatures that look, talk, and walk the same  
Pounce on the strange and exotic  
And on those who do not play their game  
Their world becoming jarringly chaotic

But donâ€™t denigrate these mammals  
For in the face of the unknown, failing to be cool  
For we are all animals  
In our own versions, of Lahboul

*I walked by a beautiful park near every day when I studied abroad in Meknes, Morocco. Supposedly, there was a zoo somewhere tucked away in the* 
*sprawling gardens. I saw very few animals walking by that park. Definitely not enough to warrant a zoo. But that didn't stop everyone from*
*finding something to leer at.*
*Many students at the center where I studied talked about how locals would stare at them when they walked around in groups.* 
*Women, Black students, Asian students, and gender non-conforming students experienced gawking more frequently and intensely just like they do*
*in the states. Conversely, I remember students doing the same to local Moroccans during our study abroad particularly when we first arrived.*
*Culture shock hits us all when we travel, especially those used to being a minority.*
