place is straight packed  
I could not believe  
My naive little eyes  
watching a ravens game  
during a late brunch  
in a filled bar  
surrounded by a pandemic

waiters crammed in between  
at the bar, the tables, the bathroom  
publicly smiling  
secretly panicking  
  
with us  
eating our eggs, drinking our drinks  
failing to convince each other  
that business is as usual  
and that   
is the scariest part  

*(2023-06-01) Here I had just eaten inside a restaurant I think for the first time since before the COVID-19 pandemic. I felt nothing but anxiety the whole time we sat. I wore my mask. I tried to go to the bathroom when there weren't many other people moving around or standing. Though it was eight months into the pandemic, the return to normalcy amazed me. No vaccines, not as much masking as there should've been. I didn't feel ready. I'm not sure I feel ready now.*
