title: Survivors march down Hilton
---

Their hearts heavy  
Heads high  
Watched over  
By loved ones lost

Strivers march down hilton  
Their fists raised  
Waving in the crisp fall air  
Cheered on  
By residents passing by  

Believers march down hilton  
Their spirits wounded  
But ever so alive  
Chanting those magic words  
Enough is Enough

*I attended a peace walk on Hilton Road that started around Green Street Academy in southwest Baltimore. I represented the State's Attorney's Office for the Southwestern Police District at the time. We ended the walk standing in front of Freddy P March's Funeral Home, where both my granparents held their viewings. Although gun violence did not take my grandparents, being back at the home returned a strong feeling of loss. Yet how beautiful it was to see so many people using their loved ones' memories to fight to make those deaths the last of their kind.*
