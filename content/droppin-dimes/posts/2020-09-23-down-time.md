Stimulation pulls my brain  
In like a magnet  
Wonâ€™t let me go  
Consumes all that I know  

As I try to unwind  
And process my time  
Spent click clacking away all day  
Faint buzzing  
Loud chirping  
Last night in

As I unite my thoughts  
Out on a page  
Craving release and peace  
Separated from the exhausting stimulation  

It rocks my head  
At times filling it with dread  
Instead of giving up I simply keep on  
I keep on going  
I write I stay free  
From the stimulation

*A doctor diagnosed me with ADD ([now considered ADHD](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/add-vs-adhd)) when I was about six years old. As an adult, one of the most apparent symptoms I still feel is how my brain just never shuts off. There's always wheels turning somewhere. I've journaled and wrote on and off my whole life, but I made it part of my routine in early 2017. Since then, writing's helped me give my brain space to work and slow down.*
