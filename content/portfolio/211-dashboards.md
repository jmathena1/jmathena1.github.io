#### 211 Maryland Data Dashboards 

From March 2021 through October 2022, I built PowerBI reports displaying data on usage of the 211 health and human service referral system by Maryland residents. The reports query data from a MySQL database I built and stored in AWS RDS (Relational Database Service). I added data weekly using the MySQL command line tool after cleaning CSV exports using R.
