#### Who owns the vacant homes in Baltimore City?

{{< figure class="port-org-image"  src="/photos/bmore-city-logo.png" >}}

I built a notebook using Marimo to calculate what percentage of houses with vacant building notices are owned by entities or people with local mailing addresses.
I used the zip codes extracted from the mailing addresses the city had on file to determine locality. I pulled the data in June 2025.
