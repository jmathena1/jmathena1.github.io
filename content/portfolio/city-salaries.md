#### The City That Works

In 2023, I conducted an exploratory analysis of Baltimore City employee salary data. I wanted to calculate basic aggregate measures like median, minimum, and maximum salary, tenure, and average raise year over year broken down by city agency. I also wanted to demonstrate how to conduct an end-to-end data analysis project using publicly available data. I published my results in a Jupyter notebook and converted the notebook into an html document. The resulting report is published on this site. Click the project view button below to check it out!
