#### The City That Works

{{< figure class="port-org-image"  src="/photos/bmore-city-logo.png" >}}

In 2023, I conducted an exploratory analysis of [Baltimore City employee salary data](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/baltimore::baltimore-city-employee-salaries-new/about). I wanted to calculate basic aggregate measures like median, minimum, and maximum salary, tenure, and average raise year over year broken down by city agency. I also wanted to demonstrate how to conduct an end-to-end data analysis project using publicly available data. I published my results in a Jupyter notebook and converted the notebook into an html document. The resulting report is published on this site. Click the project view button below to check it out!
