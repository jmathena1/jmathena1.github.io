#### Can you afford to work for Baltimore City?

{{< figure class="port-org-image"  src="/photos/bmore-city-logo.png" >}}

In a follow up to "The City That Works", I built a data app using the Observable Framework allowing users to see which city agencies pay
a living wage depending on the household make up (number of adults working and number of children). I used the [MIT Living Wage Calculator](
https://livingwage.mit.edu) to determine living wages for Baltimore city. The report uses city salary data and living wage data for 2024.
