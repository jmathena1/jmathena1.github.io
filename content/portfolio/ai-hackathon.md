#### AI Hackathon for Equity - Curious GeorgePT Project

{{< figure class="port-org-image" src="/photos/curious-george.png" >}}

In October 2024, I attended a hackathon hosted by [Hacks/Hackers](https://www.hackshackers.com/about/) in Baltimore
city. My group created a custom OpenAI GPT model and engineered prompts aiming to make the model more curious and 
ask more questions of the user.
Our project won the top prize of $500. You can read recaps of the hackathon from the [host on their site](
