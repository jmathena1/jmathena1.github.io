#### Health Equity Report in Douglas County, KS

{{< figure class="port-org-image" link="https://ldchealth.org"  src="/photos/ldchealth-logo.png" >}}

In the fall of 2018 as part of the Health Informatics team, I helped write, research, and build visuals for the first Health Equity report in Douglas County, Kansas. We measured differences in health and economic metrics like infant birth weight, life exptectancy, income, and uninsured rate. We found that poor residents and residents of color do not live as long, as well, or make as much money as higher income residents and white residents.
