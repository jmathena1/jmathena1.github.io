#### Community Court Watch in Baltimore City 

{{< figure class="port-org-image" link="https://stattorney.org"  src="/photos/osa-logo.png" >}}

From January 2020 through March 2021, I mapped cases of interest to city residents across the nine police districts in Baltimore. I collected data on charges brought, incident location, and outcome from my own work and other community liaisons on the office's Community Engagement team. I used Excel and Google Maps to manage and visualize the data.

##### Tools used: Microsoft Excel, [Google MyMaps](https://mymaps.google.com)
