#### Arabic Flagship Program - Capstone Presentation 

{{< figure class="port-org-image" link="https://thelanguageflagship.org/arabic"  src="/photos/the-language-flagship.png" >}}

In May 2017, I gave a speech exploring my internship experience in Meknes, Morocco as part of the Arabic Flagship Program. I compared my legal internship and my internship with a local mechanic to the experiences I had back in the US. The presentation was given entirely in Arabic (mostly Modern Standard with some Moroccan Darija).
