title: Some Links and Stuff (2025-04-05)
---

I've seen other bloggers make posts like this, so Im giving it a go. I often store links I like in my Wiki and I'll continue to do that.
But some links maybe don't fit so neatly into my predominantly technical wiki while still warranting notice. So I'll share some of those
links here!

- [https://aeon.co/essays/what-makes-a-person-poor-and-what-should-we-do-about-it?](
https://aeon.co/essays/what-makes-a-person-poor-and-what-should-we-do-about-it?) 
    - a bit corny at times (the _Good Will Hunting_, come onnn), but it was pretty comprehensive and took seriously the idea that
    poverty is a solveable problem

    - a very hilarious name for a very sinister strategy. The left is using government to give people things they need, so GOP strategists
    thought, what if we just made that harder and lied about it? sigh

    - one of my favorite bloggers, Julia Evans, reviews how she created a single-person mastodon server. she also talks about her likes
    and dislikes of the platform.

- i've used uv a couple times now and I'm loving it. it makes managing python for projects and even one-off little experiments sooo easy.

- Justin from Fork Around and Find Out (Cohosted with Autumn Nash) explains how to use your personal domain as your signal username.
