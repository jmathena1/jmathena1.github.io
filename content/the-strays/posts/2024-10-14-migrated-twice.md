title: Hugo is so nice, I migrated twice
---

After changing my blog and poetry site build systems to Hugo, I thought why not move everything to Hugo? 

I was recently updating my main website, which lives in its own repo. With my repos for blogging and poetry, 
that brings us to three repos with pretty much the same CSS, headers, footers, and all that jazz. 
I'm learning Go for a different sideproject so I figured why not go full in on Hugo. You don't need all that 
much Go knowledge to build a relatively simple site like mine in Hugo, but it doesn't hurt. And the nice thing 
about static site generators is that, well, they generate static files for your site. So if I get tired of Hugo, 
I can take my generated HTML files and go somewhere else. I definitely had to obtain a deeper understanding of 
Hugo templates to make this monorepo work compared to my other two Hugo sites, but I chunked the migration 
process pretty well so it didn't seem insurmountable.
