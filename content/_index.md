Hi, I'm John and I like to write. Thanks for coming to my site.  

Click on one of the logos at the bottom to check out some of my writings.  

My poetry and stories often come from memorable experiences or vivid dreams I remember to jot down and return to when I have time to process them. I've written about everything from 
an abandoned zoo in Morocco, a peace walk I attended in my city, and a dream where the devil trained me to be a demon.  

Professionally, I work as a software engineer. My deepest expertise is in data engineering and backend web development. I pivoted to software after working as a data analyst for a 
couple years. I use my portfolio page to flesh out any interesting ideas and showcase existing work.  

If you have any questions or wanna reach out to chat about something, please do so! You can send me an email at [jmathena24@gmail.com](mailto:jmathena24@gmail.com) or reach out 
through some of the social media links at the top.
