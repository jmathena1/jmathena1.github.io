			<ul>
				<li>nice brief of the history of education expansion in the US; mainly summarizing 
					the public high school movement and development of the University of California and California
					State University systems in the mid 20th century.
				</li>
				<li>as per usual (in my view): a person, place or thing in the US came up with a nifty solution to a sticky
					problem but never broke out nationwide because black people might use it.
				</li>
				<li>white liberals in the 60s ran out of steam (allegedly) trying to enforce desegregation and couldn't
					(or wouldn't) expand the generous UC and CSU higher ed funding scheme to the federal level. Instead we
					got student loans. lucky us!
