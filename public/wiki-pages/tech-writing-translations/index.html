<li>(2023-05-31) i started a mentoring program at work got paired with an engineering manager. i asked them if they
knew how developers could utilize any foreign language skills they had. he pointed me to this site. it&rsquo;s basically
a repository for every large open source project there is and it indexes what parts of the project need to be
translated and into what languages.</li>
<li>(2023-05-31) i saw that <a href="https://explore.transifex.com/qgis/qgis-documentation/">QGIS Documentation</a> is only
like 20 percent done with Arabic so that&rsquo;s definitely something i could help with.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/">https://www.writethedocs.org/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>seems to be a listserv/meetup/forum type of thing for technical writers or people who are into that. people
like me essentially. they have a slack group and their website lists a bunch of resources for aspiring and
current writers including job help, in person meets, and guides i think.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/%3Cbr%3Er/technicalwriting/">https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>sweet subreddit that i joined in 2022. very well moderated and organized. they have a whole pinned thread with
an FAQ and guide to get into technical writing.</li>
<li>in general, the programming subreddits i read are super interesting and people are very generous with their
time and knowledge. the times i&rsquo;ve seen someone act like an a$$hole there&rsquo;s several people to push back and
pump up the victim. not something you see on the internet everyday</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.plainlanguage.gov/">https://www.plainlanguage.gov/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>i think i came across this site from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/">r/technicalwriting</a> but it&rsquo;s
apparently run by volunteer federal employees and has been since the 90s. crazy! PLAIN essentially promotes the
use of plain language in US federal government communcation. a very noble pursuit!</li>

<ul>
<li>freeCodeCamp made a whole book on localization! for free! they also have a section at end detailing how you can
contribute to freeCodeCamp itself with translations. very savvy</li>
