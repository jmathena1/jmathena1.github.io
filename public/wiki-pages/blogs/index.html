<li>This is Cathy O&rsquo;Neil&rsquo;s blog. She is the author of
<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/241363/weapons-of-math-destruction-by-cathy-oneil/"><em>Weapons of Math Destruction</em></a></li>
<li>WMD (lol, great title) came out in 2016 and was very ahead of its time in critiquing the unregulated use of
big data and algorithms in a variety of domains. She has a more recent book out called the Shame Machine.</li>
<li>(2023-05-22) She appears to post pretty intermittently, which I&rsquo;ve found makes blogs more punchy.
She&rsquo;s an incredibly concise writer and has written two best selling books in less than a decade on top of running
an algorithmic consulting business. I wouldn&rsquo;t expect her to be doing free work on top of that any more often
then she deems necessary.</li>

<li>Vicki is a machine learning engineer and offers very sober, realistic, and approachable AI commentary.
She doesn&rsquo;tpost to her blog super often, but when she does it&rsquo;s very worth reading. She&rsquo;s a good person to read to
dig through the AI hype and	try to understand what building products using this stuff actually looks like
day to day.</li>

<li>i want to build this so bad! i need to figure out some authentication though. and that would be great practice!
prolly not a good idea to just have all the precious info on your house floating about in the ether.</li>

<li>definitely a favorite of mine. in addition to programming and building software, Julia makes programming related
zines. they&rsquo;re all for sale on her website. her git ones in particular I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed.</li>
