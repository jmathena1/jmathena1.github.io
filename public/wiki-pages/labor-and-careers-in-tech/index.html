<li>there&rsquo;s lots of gatekeeping in software. hierarchies of tech roles within an organization or field. in a male
dominated field, there&rsquo;s unfortunately a lot of jockeying for status. and that of course takes its toll on the
women who are entering or currently working in tech</li>
<li>as they point out in the article, the early days of computing were dominated by women. the field itself was
founded and then tremendously advanced by women as well - Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper - though that didn&rsquo;t
stop the men from taking over once industry thought they could make money with these machines.</li>

<li>social impacts of technology or otherwise, dr. tressie mcmillan cottom is one of our best contemporary social
scientsts - she&rsquo;s a sociologist by training. her book of essays <a href="https://thenewpress.com/books/thick/">Thick</a>
is a great read and she has a book <a href="https://thenewpress.com/books/lower-ed/">Lower Ed</a> mentioned in the article that
is high on my reading list!</li>

<ul>
<li>great breakdown of <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century">the sexiest job of the 21st century</a> lots of hype surrounding data science
in general and AI in particular</li>
<li>(2023-05-28) interviewee gives a pretty entertaining overview of the field as of 2017. even post chat-gpt,
not much has changed.</li>

<ul>
<li>a reader of this blog i guess wrote in to the author asking if they should get a new job. they don&rsquo;t like being
a senior and want more IC work. author said do it! GTFO! their rationale was that a new position would be a chance
to gain seniority all over again and grow a ton (reader mentioned this was their first job).
it&rsquo;s important to hear that it&rsquo;s ok to remain at the mid-level so you can learn and grow. US work culture
prioritizes growth above all else so this advice is golden especially from a seasoned developer.</li>

<li>i love learning about learning. and this is a great article for that. it&rsquo;s aimed at software developers
but i think it applies to anyone really.</li>

<ul>
<li>i actually used this for my most recent job search process. I liked this post because while it did have some
specific questions, it mostly gave you a framework or way to think about how to ask questions to your interviewer.
great read if you&rsquo;re prepping for an interview in tech or out of it.</li>
