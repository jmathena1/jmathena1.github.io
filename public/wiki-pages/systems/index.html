<ul>
<li>decentralization is definitely a term people throw around a lot because it makes them sound smart and
progressive. i don&rsquo;t think decentralization is itself a bad thing but it&rsquo;s also good to be precise about what we
want and how we want to do it. this article breaks down different decentralization frameworks in networking
including mesh networks, blockchains, and more.</li>

<li>(2023-05-30) as i progress forward in my development career, I will eventually be architecting not just apps but
entire systems. I saw a couple people post about this book and I intend on beefing up my systems knowledge to be
successful as an SME eventually.</li>

<li>this medium article argues good software is exstensible and doesn&rsquo;t try to do to much. it points to programs
like Obsidian, the notetaking app, and unix-based command line paradigms. it&rsquo;s a rare article where most of the
products they discussed I have both used and enjoyed!</li>

<ul>
<li>this is the transcript of a talk the author gave to Startup School. it stressed the importance of working
through the little problems and not needing to always swing for the fences when making a company or just
working on problems in general.	there were lots of littles gems throughout the talk as well like how &ldquo;logic&rdquo; and
&ldquo;reason&rdquo; are useful but can also trap us in dogmatic thinking. not one for business world, ted talk stuff (this
wasn&rsquo;t a ted talk but just that kind of presentation), but this one was solid.</li>
