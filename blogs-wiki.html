				<li>This is Cathy O'Neil's blog. 
					She is the author of 
						<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/241363/weapons-of-math-destruction-by-cathy-oneil/">
							<i>Weapons of Math Destruction</i>.

				<li>WMD (lol, great title) came out in 2016 and was very ahead of its time in critiquing the unregulated use
				of big data and algorithms in a variety of domains. She has a more recent book out called the Shame Machine. </li> 
				<li>(2023-05-22) She appears to post pretty intermittently, which I've found makes blogs more punchy.
				She's an incredibly concise writer and has written two best selling books in less than a decade on top of running
				an algorithmic consulting business. I wouldn't expect her to be doing free work on top of that any more often
				then she deems necessary.</li>

				<li>Vicki is a machine learning engineer and offers very sober, realistic, and approachable AI commentary. She doesn't
					post to her blog super often, but when she does it's very worth reading. She's a good person to read to dig through the AI hype and
					try to understand what building products using this stuff actually looks like day to day.

				<li>i want to build this so bad! i need to figure out some authentication though.
					and that would be great practice! prolly not a good idea to just have all the precious
					info on your house floating about in the ether.

                <li>definitely a favorite of mine. in addition to programming and building software, Julia makes programming related
                    zines. they're all for sale on her website. her git ones in particular I've really enjoyed.
