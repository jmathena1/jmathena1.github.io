# Welcome to my site!

I built this personal site, blog, and digital garden using the static site builder Hugo, written in Go.

The steps to running this site locally are:
1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/)
2. Clone this repo
3. Navigate to the root of the cloned repo and run `hugo serve` on the command line
4. You should be able to open the home page on your machine's browser

Hugo's directory structure [documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/) will tell you what you can find in each
of the subfolders.

Happy blogging!
