				<li> I didn't follow this tutorial exactly when building my blogs on this site.</li>
				<li> But I completed some of the steps and ended up hosting on GitHub Pages (so easy!).</li>
				<li> The post above lists numerous references for Git, GitHub, Markdown, and Jekyll, all of which
				I ended up using in different capacities to launch the site you're browsing!</li>

				<li>MK Docs is another static site generator, but it's gotta be the most lightweight one I've seen yet.
					Their site says it's geared toward project documentation, which makes sense from seeing examples.
					I learned recently that the <a href="http://bmoreblack.tech">Baltimore Black Techies website</a>
					is built using MK docs. It's nice to know I can quickly spin up some great project documentation for
					future work! I'll be sure to link any sites I push out using this framework here.
