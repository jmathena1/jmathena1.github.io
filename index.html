		<p>Hi, I'm John and I like to write. Thanks for coming to my site.</p>
		<p>My poetry and stories often come from memorable experiences or vivid dreams 
		I remember to jot down and return to when I have time to process them. I've
		written about everything from an abandoned zoo in Morocco, a peace walk I attended in my city,
		and a dream where the devil trained me to be a demon.</p>
		<p>Professionally, I work as a data engineer and analyst. I use my portfolio page to flesh out any interesting ideas and 
		showcase existing work.</p>
		<p>If you have any questions or wanna reach out to chat about something, please do so! You can 
		send me an email at <a href="mailto:jmathena24@gmail.com">jmathena24@gmail.com</a> 
		or reach out through some of the social media links at the bottom.
