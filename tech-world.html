				<li> (2023-05-24) outlets like logic magazine do such a good job of showcasing technology development
					and use beyond just silicon valley. <a href="https://restofworld.org/">rest of world</a> also does great writing
					and reporting in this area so this page will probably showcase some of their stuff eventually.</li>
				<li>all these articles also put the person at the center. the tech is cool, yes. the tech can help us, yes.
					but the people make it happen. and the people make it better! </li>
				<li>dr. loubani had a great quote in the last article about how the tourniquets his group manufactured
					in Canada were breaking in the field in Gaza. the palestinian medics were like "these things are snapping"
					and he didn't get why until he was in the field trying to use one while getting shot at and dodging shrapnel.
					an extreme example but ultimately people make the tech work, not the other way around! </li>
