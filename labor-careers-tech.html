				<li>there's lots of gatekeeping in software. hierarchies of tech roles within an organization or
					field. in a male dominated field, there's unfortunately a lot of jockeying for status. and that 
					of course takes its toll on the women who are entering or currently working in tech.</li> 
				<li>as they point out in the article, the early days of computing were dominated by women. the field itself was founded
					and then tremendously advanced by women as well - Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper - though that didn't
					stop the men from taking over once industry thought they could make money with these machines.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>a reader of this blog i guess wrote in to the author asking if they should get a new job.
					they don't like being a senior and want more IC work. author said do it! GTFO! their
					rationale was that a new position would be a chance to gain seniority all over again
					and grow a ton (reader mentioned this was their first job). it's important to hear that
					it's ok to remain at the mid-level so you can learn and grow. US work culture
					prioritizes growth above all else so this advice is golden especially from a seasoned
					developer.
