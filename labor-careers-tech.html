        	<li>there's lots of gatekeeping in software. hierarchies of tech roles within an organization or
        		field. in a male dominated field, there's unfortunately a lot of jockeying for status. and that 
        		of course takes its toll on the women who are entering or currently working in tech.</li> 
        	<li>as they point out in the article, the early days of computing were dominated by women. the field itself was founded
        		and then tremendously advanced by women as well - Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper - though that didn't
        		stop the men from taking over once industry thought they could make money with these machines.</li>
