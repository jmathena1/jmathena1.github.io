			<li>(2023-05-31) i started a mentoring program at work got paired with an engineering manager. i asked
				them if they knew how developers could utilize any foreign language skills they had. he pointed me to 
				this site. it's basically a repository for every large open source project there is and it indexes
				what parts of the project need to be translated and into what languages.</li>
			<li>(2023-05-31) i saw that <a href="https://explore.transifex.com/qgis/qgis-documentation/">QGIS Documentation</a> is only
				like 20 percent done with Arabic so that's definitely something i could help with. </li>

			<li>seems to be a listserv/meetup/forum type of thing for technical writers or people who are into
				that. people like me essentially. they have a slack group and their website lists a bunch of resources
				for aspiring and current writers including job help, in person meets, and guides i think.</li>

			<li>sweet subreddit that i joined in 2022. very well moderated and organized. they have a whole pinned
				thread with an FAQ and guide to get into technical writing.</li>
			<li>in general, the programming subreddits i read are super interesting and people are very generous
        		with their time and knowledge. the times i've seen someone act like an a**hole there's several people
        		to push back and pump up the victim. not something you see on the internet everyday</li>

			<li>i think i came across this site from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/">r/technicalwriting</a>
				but it's apparently run by volunteer federal employees and has been since the 90s. crazy! PLAIN essentially
				promotes the use of plain language in US federal government communcation. a very noble pursuit!</li>

			<li>freeCodeCamp made a whole book on localization! for free! they also have a section at end detailing how you can contribute to freeCodeCamp
				itself with translations. very savvy
