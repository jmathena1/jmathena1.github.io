        ### Technical Writing and Translations

        https://explore.transifex.com/
        - (2023-05-31) i started a mentoring program at work got paired with an engineering manager. i asked
        them if they knew how developers could utilize any foreign language skills they had. he pointed me to 
        this site. it's basically a repository for every large open source project there is and it indexes
        what parts of the project need to be translated and into what languages.
        - (2023-05-31) i saw that [QGIS Documentation](https://explore.transifex.com/qgis/qgis-documentation/) is only
        like 20 percent done with Arabic so that's definitely something i could help with.

        https://www.writethedocs.org/
        - seems to be a listserv/meetup/forum type of thing for technical writers or people who are into
        that. people like me essentially. they have a slack group and their website lists a bunch of resources
        for aspiring and current writers including job help, in person meets, and guides i think.

        https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/
        - sweet subreddit that i joined in 2022. very well moderated and organized. they have a whole pinned
        thread with an FAQ and guide to get into technical writing.
        - in general, the programming subreddits i read are super interesting and people are very generous
        with their time and knowledge. the times i've seen someone act like an a**hole there's several people
        to push back and pump up the victim. not something you see on the internet everyday

        https://www.plainlanguage.gov/
        - i think i came across this site from [r/technicalwriting]( https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/)
        but it's apparently run by volunteer federal employees and has been since the 90s. crazy! PLAIN essentially
        promotes the use of plain language in US federal government communcation. a very noble pursuit!
