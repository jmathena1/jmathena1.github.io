        ### Labor and Careers in Tech  
        https://logicmag.io/intelligence/javascript-is-for-girls/
        - there's lots of gatekeeping in software. hierarchies of tech roles within an organization or
        field. in a male dominated field, there's unfortunately a lot of jockeying for status. and that 
        of course takes its toll on the women who are entering or currently working in tech. 
        - as they point out in the article, the early days of computing were dominated by women. the field itself was founded
        and then tremendously advanced by women as well - Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper - though that didn't
        stop the men from taking over once industry thought they could make money with these machines.
