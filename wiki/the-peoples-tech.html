        <ul>
            <li>very succinct breakdown of the limits of computers. goes into human-in-the-loop systems and
                how to know when something just needs to be done by a person. hint: it's a lot more often than many
                want to admit.</li>
            <li>The author, Dr. Meredith Broussard, wrote a deeper dive into dumb computers in
                <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262537018/artificial-unintelligence/"><i>Artificial Unintelligence</i></a>.
                That book's been on my list for a hot minute, so if you check it out and like it let me know.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Project Cybersyn is criminally underdiscussed in the tech and lefty circles in which I've
                found myself. the chilean people democratically elected a socialist in 1970 (albeit narrowly)
                and the president directly appointed a team to modernize the economy using IT.</li>
            <li>though a classic US backed coup preceded by brutal economic blockades and sanctions ended
                Allende's presidency in a series of firing squads, the project remains inspirational. 
                at least to me</li>
            <li>if you want a deeper dive, Professor Eden Medina wrote a wonderful book on the project called 
                <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262525961/cybernetic-revolutionaries/">
                    <i>Cybernetic Revolutionaries</i></a>.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>the first director of post-revolutionary Cuba's national library in Havana wanted the
                <i>biblioteca popular</i> to take an active approach to educating and enriching the lives of  Cuban residents. 
                they drove buses out to the farms and indexed books banned by previous regimes. they also made 
                leaps and bounds in library IT, making huge contributions to the field that would become 
                information science.</li>
            <li>it's so thrilling and motivating to see people around the world fight so hard to build better
                worlds for themselves and their people in the face of such hardship, especially through computing.
                the field doesn't have a huge reputation for freeing the masses though many coders may wanna 
                believe that.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>a moderately peeved Ursula K. Le Guin critiques many SciFi enthusiasts' superficial and 
                one-dimensional understanding of technology. one reviewer desribed her as "not a hard SF writer",
                "technology is notably absent".</li>
            <li>perhaps the story this person reviewed didn't feature faster than light travel or hoverbikes, 
                but after reading the Dispossessed I'd be pretty off base calling Le Guin a soft SciFi writer.</li>
            <li>as she lays out in just a few paragraphs, technology is everything people do to interact with their
                physical environment. It's not just what's happening in an R&D lab.</li>
            <li>on top of that, just as if not more interesting than how the machines in any
                fictional universe work is how their societies work. she covers that too</li>
