			<li>This is Cathy O'Neil's blog. 
				She is the author of 
					<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/241363/weapons-of-math-destruction-by-cathy-oneil/">
						<i>Weapons of Math Destruction</i>.

			<li>WMD (lol, great title) came out in 2016 and was very ahead of its time in critiquing the unregulated use
            of big data and algorithms in a variety of domains. She has a more recent book out called the Shame Machine. </li> 
            <li>(2023-05-22) She appears to post pretty intermittently, which I've found makes blogs more punchy.
            She's an incredibly concise writer and has written two best selling books in less than a decade on top of running
            an algorithmic consulting business. I wouldn't expect her to be doing free work on top of that any more often
            then she deems necessary.</li>

			<li>Vicki is a machine learning engineer and offers very sober, realistic, and approachable AI commentary. She doesn't
				post to her blog super often, but when she does it's very worth reading. She's a good person to read to dig through the AI hype and
				try to understand what building products using this stuff actually looks like day to day.
